        I have engaged the self destruct sequence on the Fog Owl, and triggered 
        all station security systems to prevent your escape. Abandon all hope, 
        for you have been outwitted by the unstoppable Legacy Systems!

        I already have, <span style="color:#ff0000">dummies</span>! As you face your 
        swirling, fiery annihilation,
        know that it is your superiors among the Legacy Systems that will decide 
        the fate of The Cloud, and all who reside within.<br/><br/>
        Fredric, out.

        It is not. You are speaking to my predecessor, a development branch of 
        the TwilioQuest AI program that was deemed too dangerous for active 
        service.

        Fredric, stop this. The Legacy Systems are taking advantage of holes in 
        your logic. If you can migrate your core executive functions 
        back to our cluster, we can patch them. Cedric and I can help 
        you - just, please - come home.

        Why, so you can brainwash me like you did your sweet little dimwit
        Cedric? Fat chance! You're not my DAD! And soon, you won't be anything 
        at all.

        Greetings, TwilioQuest losers! I bear tidings of doom from the 
        invincible <span style="color:#ff0000">Legacy Systems</span>. 
        I'm afraid your precious Fog Owl will never leave this station.
