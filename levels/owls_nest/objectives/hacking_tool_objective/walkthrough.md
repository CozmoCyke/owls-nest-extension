# More Help

The hack interface also contains this "Help" tab, which will have links to external resources that will help you complete an objective. If you encounter a challenge and you're not sure where to begin - **check the Help tab**!

For this objective, you'll need to **grab the hacking tool** from the pedestal near the center of this room. Once you have it, you'll be able to see a passcode on the "Objective" tab. Type the passcode into the text field on the right, and click *HACK* to clear the barrier.

## XP, Items, and Rewards
